## Visualization
Similar to [Behaviour](../Behaviours/BehaviourBase.md)s, which together define the behaviour of an object, objects
can have a Visualization script. This defines in broad lines what kind of en object this is. The base script holds
a reference to anything visual about the object. Including the outlines one can see when looking at an object inside
the AR/VR environment.
